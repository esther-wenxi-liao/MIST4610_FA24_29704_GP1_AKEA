# Project Scenario

At Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson Airport, hundreds of flights land and take off every day, and the airport needs to:​

- Track flights arriving from and departing to various destinations.​

- Assign terminal gates to each flight.​

- Monitor crew members and airport staff working at the airport.​

- Verify that the appropriate employees are certified for certain plane before assigning them to a flight.​

- Manage passenger flow efficiently through ticketing and boarding.​


Our project simulates how an airport can manage these operational complexities through a well-designed database system that tracks and organizes flight-related information.​


The data comprises a sampling of domestic flights coming in and out of Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson Airport on October 3, 2024 along with associated airline and plane data.​
