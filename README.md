# Project Scenario

## Inspiration 

The idea for this project emerged from the complex nature of airline operations, where numerous components—such as flights, passengers, employees, and planes—must be managed efficiently to ensure smooth functioning. Through discussions with our group and instructor, we recognized that airlines face significant challenges in tracking flights, assigning crew, managing passenger ticketing, and ensuring staff certifications. Many current systems used by airlines often lack the flexibility and integration required to manage all these elements in a centralized way. This prompted us to create a comprehensive data model to unify these components in a logical and cohesive manner.

Our team aimed to design a solution that not only tracks day-to-day operations but also provides real-time data for better decision-making. After exploring various approaches, we determined that a robust relational database model would effectively address these challenges. By tracking the key relationships between flights, employees, planes, and passengers, the model enhances operational efficiency and data accuracy, enabling the airline to better manage its operations.

To simplify the scope of this project and avoid building an overly complex system, we focused on a specific date—October 3, 2024—capturing a sample of domestic flights in and out of Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson Airport. This allows us to demonstrate how the system would work while keeping the dataset manageable, providing an accurate and practical simulation of airline operations.

## System Workflow and Functionality

The data model connects various entities involved in airline operations through well-defined relationships. **Flights** are the central focus, linking to other key components such as **Passengers**, **Planes**, **Employees**, and **Airports**. Each flight in the system has passengers who purchase tickets, and each flight is serviced by a crew that must be appropriately certified for the plane being used.

For example, a passenger purchasing a ticket is linked to a specific flight, and that flight has an assigned plane that is operated by an airline. Employees like pilots and flight attendants are assigned to flights, but they need the correct certifications for the plane model they are operating or servicing. The data model ensures that only qualified employees are scheduled for each flight, that the plane's capacity matches the number of tickets sold, and that the airline can keep track of employee contracts over time.

Each entity—whether it’s a flight, a plane, or an employee—interacts through foreign keys and relationships that enable the system to capture real-world airline operations. The **Ticket** table bridges passengers and flights, the **AirCrew** table links employees to flights, and the **Certificate** table tracks employee certifications for plane models. This structure ensures that data is not only accurate but also logically connected, reducing redundancies and potential for errors.


## Main Purpose

The primary purpose of this project is to simulate how Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson Airport can manage the operational complexities involved in tracking flights, passengers, planes, and employees through a well-designed database system. Specifically, the project focuses on a sampling of domestic flights arriving at and departing from Atlanta on October 3, 2024, along with associated airline and plane data. This targeted approach allows us to demonstrate how the system efficiently handles key operational components without overwhelming it with the full scope of daily airport activity.

The goal is to create a centralized data model that enhances both the accuracy and efficiency of managing flight operations. The model organizes flight information, ensures that employees are properly assigned to flights with the correct certifications, and tracks which planes are used for each flight. By limiting the dataset to a specific day and set of domestic flights, the project simplifies real-world complexities while maintaining realistic airline operations.

This system serves several key objectives:

- **Operational Efficiency:** The model ensures that flights are accurately tracked, planes are appropriately assigned, and employees are assigned based on their certifications. The focused scope helps streamline the handling of data for the selected flights, preventing conflicts and ensuring operational readiness for that particular day.
- **Data Integrity:** By organizing the relationships between flights, airlines, passengers, and planes, the model reduces the chance for data discrepancies. The system’s relational structure ensures that data flows consistently across the different entities.
- **Focused Simulation:** Instead of covering the entire airport’s operations, we focus on a manageable dataset—one day’s worth of domestic flights. This allows us to highlight the system's ability to handle key elements of airport management effectively, simulating real-world airline operations on a smaller, more comprehensible scale.
- **Decision-Making Support:** The system provides airport management with real-time information on flights, staffing, and plane assignments for October 3, 2024. This helps support timely decisions about flight scheduling and resource allocation during the day.

# Data Model

![Final Draft Model](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c8f733e-3459-4f55-b031-0f3bc2d4d5d9)


## Flight, Passenger, and Ticket Relationship: Many-to-Many (M : M) through Ticket (Non-Identifying)

The relationship between **Flight**, **Passenger**, and **Ticket** is many-to-many because each flight can have multiple passengers, and each passenger can have multiple tickets for different flights. The **Ticket** table serves as a bridge, connecting these two entities while also storing key information such as seat number, class, and ticket price. 

In this model, **Ticket** has a composite primary key `ticketNum`, ensuring that each ticket is uniquely identified. Additionally, **Ticket** contains two foreign keys: `flightNum` (linking it to the **Flight** table) and `idPassenger` (linking it to the **Passenger** table). This setup keeps clear records of which passengers are on each flight, as well as their seat numbers and travel class.

The data type for `ticketNum` is `VARCHAR(10)` to accommodate various formats of ticket numbers, which can be a mix of alphanumeric characters. Prices are stored as `DECIMAL(6,2)` to handle currency with precision, ensuring accuracy for ticket prices.

---


## Airport and Flight Relationship: One-to-Many (1 : M)

The relationship between **Airport** and **Flight** is one-to-many, as each flight departs from or arrives at one airport, but each airport can manage multiple flights. The **Airport** table stores information about different airports, while **Flight** tracks the scheduled flights departing from or arriving at these airports.

The primary key of **Airport** is `airportCode`, a three-character IATA code (e.g., ATL for Atlanta). This ensures that each airport is uniquely identified. In the **Flight** table, `airportCode` is a foreign key that links each flight to its respective airport. The data type for `airportCode` is `CHAR(3)` to enforce a standardized length of three characters for all airport codes. 

---

## Flight and Employee Relationship: Many-to-Many (M : M) through AirCrew (Identifying)

The relationship between **Flight** and **Employee** is many-to-many, facilitated by the **AirCrew** table. Each flight can have multiple employees (e.g., pilots, flight attendants), and each employee can be assigned to multiple flights in a single day. The **AirCrew** table tracks which employees are working on each flight and their respective roles onboard.

**AirCrew** has a composite primary key consisting of `flightNum` and `idEmployee`, ensuring that each employee's assignment to a specific flight is unique. The foreign keys `flightNum` (linking to the **Flight** table) and `idEmployee` (linking to the **Employee** table) ensure that the correct employees are assigned to the right flights. The role of the employee onboard is represented by `roleOnboard`, an `ENUM` data type, as the roles are predefined (e.g., pilot, flight attendant).

---

## Airline and Employee Relationship: Many-to-Many (M : M) through EmployeeContract (Identifying)

The **Airline** and **Employee** entities are related through a many-to-many relationship, handled by the **EmployeeContract** table. An airline can employ many employees, and each employee may work for multiple airlines over their career, but only for one at a time. The **EmployeeContract** table records the employment history of employees, including when they joined and left an airline.

The composite primary key for **EmployeeContract** is made up of `airlineCode` and `idEmployee`, which ensures that each contract between an airline and an employee is unique. Foreign keys `airlineCode` and `idEmployee` link the **EmployeeContract** table to the **Airline** and **Employee** tables, respectively. The data types `joinedDate` and `resignedDate` are `DATE` fields to accurately record the employee’s start and end dates with the airline.

---

## Employee and PlaneModel Relationship: Many-to-Many (M : M) through Certificate (Identifying)

The **Employee** and **PlaneModel** entities have a many-to-many relationship, facilitated by the **Certificate** table. Employees, particularly pilots and crew, need to be certified to operate specific plane models. The **Certificate** table tracks which employees are certified to operate or serve on which plane models.

The composite primary key of **Certificate** (`idModelName` and `idEmployee`) uniquely identifies each certification. Foreign keys `idModelName` and `idEmployee` link to the **PlaneModel** and **Employee** tables, respectively. This setup ensures that the system can track which employees are certified for which plane models. The `certificationDate` field is of type `DATE` to store the precise date when an employee received their certification.

---

## PlaneModel and Plane Relationship: One-to-Many (1 : M)

Each **PlaneModel** (such as a Boeing 737 or Airbus A320) can have multiple planes, but each **Plane** is associated with only one plane model. This one-to-many relationship is essential for tracking the specific details of each individual plane and its associated model.

The **Plane** table contains the foreign key `modelName`, linking it to the **PlaneModel** table, which holds details about the model, such as capacity and maximum distance. The data types for these fields are set to `INT` as they represent numeric values for capacity and distance.

---

## Airline and Plane Relationship: One-to-Many (1 : M)

Each **Airline** can operate many planes, but each **Plane** belongs to one specific airline. The **Airline** table holds the details of each airline, and the **Plane** table links to it via the foreign key `airlineCode`.

The foreign key `airlineCode` is of type `CHAR(2)`, as airlines use standardized two-character IATA codes (e.g., DL for Delta) to identify themselves. This relationship allows us to track which airline operates which planes, ensuring clarity in airline ownership and plane usage.

---

## Flight and Plane Relationship: One-to-Many (1 : M)

A **Flight** can only be assigned one **Plane**, but each **Plane** can be used for multiple flights. This one-to-many relationship is crucial for tracking which plane is assigned to which flight. The **Flight** table contains the foreign key `planeRegistrationNum`, linking it to the **Plane** table, which holds the plane’s details.

The `planeRegistrationNum` is of type `VARCHAR(45)` to accommodate alphanumeric registration numbers, which can vary in length depending on the country and regulatory body. This ensures that the system can handle various registration formats while tracking plane assignments.

### Explanation
This query identifies plane models that were not used for any flights on October 3, 2024. By using NOT EXISTS, the query compares the **Plane** and **Flight** tables and returns plane models that are not associated with any flights on the specified date.

### Managerial Relevance
Identifying underutilized planes is crucial for fleet management and resource optimization. Managers can use this query to track planes that are sitting idle, helping them make decisions about better plane allocation, whether to retire underused planes, or how to adjust flight schedules to maximize the use of available resources. This query ensures that airlines are getting the most out of their fleet, reducing unnecessary costs from keeping planes idle.
